    <p id="p1">
        <b>Ayurveda is a science of life with a holistic approach to health and personalized medicine. It is one of the oldest medical systems, which comprises thousands of medical concepts and hypothesis. Interestingly, Ayurveda has ability to treat many chronic diseases such as cancer, diabetes, arthritis, and asthma, which are untreatable in modern medicine. Unfortunately, due to lack of scientific validation in various concepts, this precious gift from our ancestors is trailing. Hence, evidence-based research is highly needed for global recognition and acceptance of Ayurveda, which needs further advancements in the research methodology. The present review highlights various fields of research including literary, fundamental, drug, pharmaceutical, and clinical research in Ayurveda. The review further focuses to improve the research methodology for Ayurveda with main emphasis on the fundamental research. This attempt will certainly encourage young researchers to work on various areas of research for the development and promotion of Ayurveda.</b>

        Indroduction
    </header>
    <p id="p2">
        <b>Ayurveda, the traditional Indian medicinal system remains the most ancient yet living traditions with sound philosophical and experimental basis. It is a science of life with a holistic approach to health and personalized medicine. It is known to be a complete medical system that comprised physical, psychological, philosophical, ethical, and spiritual health. In Ayurveda, each cell is considered to be inherently an essential expression of pure intelligence hence called self-healing science. In addition, to the self-healing concept, the use of herbal treatment is equally important in this Indian traditional system of medicine.</b>
    </p>
    <p id="p3">
        <b>According to the World Health Organization, about 70-80% of the world populations rely on nonconventional medicines mainly of herbal sources in their healthcare. Public interest for the treatment with complementary and alternative medicine is mainly due to increased side effects in synthetic drugs, lack of curative treatment for several chronic diseases, high cost of new drugs, microbial resistance, and emerging diseases, etc.</b>

        Why Ayurvedic System of Medicine Lagging Behind?
    </header>
    <p id="p4">
        <b>Undoubtedly, in comparison to allopathic treatment, Ayurvedic treatment is more effective in most of the chronic diseases. However, the popularity of Ayurveda is rather lesser as the majority of the global population prefers modern medicine because of its ability to give fast relief from diseases as compared to Ayurvedic treatment. Recently, the awareness and thus fear of toxicity to allopathic drugs and the high cost of healthcare are causing an increasingly large number of people to seek alternatives. Rather than competing and veering towards the Western medicine, the Ayurvedic scientists should work to enhance the core competency of Ayurveda without compromising its fundamental principles.Some major points which are responsible for trailing the Ayurveda are as following.</b>
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li><i><b>Young Ayurvedic scholars, although enthusiastic, are not clear about their views on the future of Ayurveda. Moreover, they are not even very clear that how to expose their valuable research outputs on Ayurveda</b></i></li>
        <li><i><b>Only a few organizations have well-established research infrastructure for exclusive research in Ayurveda. Experienced researchers with knowledge of modern technologies are required to conduct advance and quality research in Ayurveda</b></i></li>
        <li><i><b>There is a lack of cooperation and willingness of Biomedical Scientists who are often unduly skeptical and carry prejudice</b></i></li>
        <li><i><b>More than a thousand Ayurvedic postgraduates pass out each year and enter into the streamline of academics and practice. Among them, only a few choose their profession as researcher in Ayurveda</b></i></li>
        <li><i><b>Neither has the Ayurvedic teaching changed in the last 50 years nor have the textbooks enriched with new research methodologies.</b></i></li><br>
        
        <p id="p5"><b>These are some of the following major points those should be highly needed to consider in the Ayurvedic research for its advancement.</b></p>

            Improvement in research methodology
        </header>
        <p id="p6">
           Research methodology is a way to systematic collection, analysis, and interpretation of data to solve a research problem. India does not need to prove the validity of Ayurveda to its people, authorities, and own scientific community because it is a recognized traditional medical system of the country. There is a need of fundamental research on Ayurveda to refresh and upgrade the tremendous knowledge diluted through time particularly during the British rule. This kind of research will certainly upgrade the fundamental knowledge of Ayurveda, which will be benefitted not only to Indian but also to foreign nationals. This will assure Ayurveda to be practiced with its whole potential and allowed to gain wide recognition. Research is a process that converts data into information, information into knowledge, and knowledge into wisdom. In the present scenario, Ayurvedic researches are failing in this aspect as these are unable to disseminate the knowledge gained from the exercises.</p>
        <p id="p7">
            The glorious past of the research methodology of Ayurveda is based on the tools of examination known as Pareeksha and inspired from the philosophical term Pramaana, which refers to the evidence.These tools of the examination include (i) the direct observation <em>(Pratyaksha)</em>, (ii) the inference <em>(Anumana)</em>, and (iii) the authoritative testimonies or literature <em>(Aptopadesha)</em>. The modern day research also depends on these three basic tools whose efficacy has been augmented by the utility of the scientific and technological innovative devices. These methods of investigations have been planned to develop the backbone of the Ayurveda system in the form basic principles under the fundamental research. The quality researches on Ayurveda basics with advanced scientific techniques can expand the knowledge and path of current medical science. Predominantly, drug researches done in the field of Ayurveda in the last six decades have not enriched the Ayurvedic understandings or Ayurvedic concepts. However, these researches have created a better understanding of Ayurveda by the modern medical fraternity.
